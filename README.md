# Education-Inequality
The project aims to investigate the correlation between educational outcomes and socioeconomic factors in U.S. high schools. ACT and SAT scores will be used as indicators of educational outcomes. The project will assess the extent to which area socioeconomic factors predict ACT and SAT scores.

## Data
Two data sets will be used: EdGap_data.xlsx and ccd_sch_029_1617_w_1a_11212017.csv. 

The primary data set is EdGap_data from [EdGap.org](edgap.org). It is from 2016 and includes average ACT or SAT scores for schools and several socioeconomic characteristics of the school district. The socioeconomic data (household income, unemployment, adult educational attainment, and family structure) are from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. ACT and SAT score data is from each state’s department of education or some other public data release. It is not indicated how EdGap.org processed the data.

The school information data set is basic information about each school from the [National Center for Education Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/pubschuniv.asp).

The data set EdGap_data.xlsx can be accessed from the [Github repository for DATA 3320](https://github.com/brian-fischer/DATA-3320) in the [education folder](https://github.com/brian-fischer/DATA-3320/tree/main/education). 

The data set ccd_sch_029_1617_w_1a_11212017.csv is too large for Github and can be accessed from the dropbox link:
